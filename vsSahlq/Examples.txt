How to use the extracted Haskell program and examples
------------------

Once you have run ghci on "Main.hs" and have loaded the extracted *.hs files, you can compute the first-order correspondents by calling the function "corr" followed by a space and the modal correspondent. Here are some examples that you can copy and paste yourself (and press enter):

  - corr ( (p 1) --> (dia (p 1)) )
  - corr ( (dia (p 1)) --> (box (dia (p 1))) )
  - corr ( (p 1) --> (dia (dia (p 1))) )

The following indicate the correct syntax that ghci will accept:

  - proposition variable : p n, where n is a natural number.
  - negation : neg
  - conjunction : /\
  - disjunction : \/
  - implication : -->
  - box : box
  - diamond : dia
